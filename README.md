## A Pictochat (DS) like chat server/web-client

I made this during the 2020 Corona Quarantine, as a personal challange during the boredom. Similar to Nintendo's Pictochat, you send drawn images as messages to chat rooms.

The server.py can be run with `python server.py`, opening the server to your local network. The server can be port forwarded to allow for global usage, too.
